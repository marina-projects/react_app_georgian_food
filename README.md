# Georgian food in USA react app

This is a [basic search app](https://georgian-food.netlify.app/) that uses Yelp API to allow users to search Georgian eatery in USA cities. 

In the app users can see a list of restaurants in different cities, search in it by key words, sort by rating and reviews count.
